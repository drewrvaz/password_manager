## Description
PassSAVE allows users to easily and safely store their passwords to different websites/accounts that they have, to test to see whether or not their password is too easily guessed, to create new passwords, and to share their passwords. We wanted to create an app that was unique. We also wanted something that would be easy for people to use, while also offering a product that would be useful to all users of the web. Building this app gave us the opportunity to use parts of node that we hadnâ€™t used before.

## User Story
IF you want to sign in, THEN login in using your username and password.
IF you want to logout, THEN click the logout button.
IF you want to sign up, THEN click the sign up button and enter a username, a password, and a confirmed password.
IF you want to save your passwords in the database, THEN you can add them to your account using the add feature.
IF you want to test your password strength, THEN you can click the test feature to run it against a database of common passwords.
IF you want to share your password, THEN you can get a one time passcode (6 digits in length) to reveal the password before sharing it.
